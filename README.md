5BR3C - 5 Band Resistor Color Code Calculator

You can easily identify the colored ring resistance, do not know how to see the colored ring resistance of the resistor can be calculated, as well as colored ring resistance readings and colored ring resistance of notation, etc.


5 Band Resistor Color Code Calculator readings and notation:
Example: 5 Band Resistor as follows: red, yellow, red, black and gold for 242Ω read error is ± 0.5%
Example: 5 Band Resistor were: orange white yellow red silver read 39400Ω = 39.4K error of ± 10%

From the above that, read the fourth color is gold or silver rings must pay attention, because it is multiplied by a negative number.

About error rate: The rate thanks to a software error should be multiplied by 100, as calculated thanks to a display error multiplied by 100 = 0.02 in 2%
